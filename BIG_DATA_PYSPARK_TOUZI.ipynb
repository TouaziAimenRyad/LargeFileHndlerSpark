The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and \\nevents are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...\\n\\nWALTER M. MILLER, JR\\n\\n\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\"\\nOne gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives\\ncopying blueprints from \"Saint Leibowitz\", filling the sheets of paper with\\nink and leaving white lines and letters.\\n\\nEDGAR PANGBORN\\n\\n\"Davy\"\\nPost atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,\\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\\natoms\". \\n\\nPHILIP K. DICK\\n\\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\\ntrue version.\\n\\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\\n\\nPETER DE ROSA\\n\\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums\",\\nDroemer-Knaur, 1989)\\n\\nMICHAEL MARTIN\\n\\n\"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification\", Temple University Press,\\n Philadelphia, USA.\\nA detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding\\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\\narea.  Argues both for \"negative atheism\" (i.e. the \"non-belief in the\\nexistence of god(s)\") and also for \"positive atheism\" (\"the belief in the\\nnon-existence of god(s)\").  Includes great refutations of the most\\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\\n541 pages.

The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and \\nevents are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...\\n\\nWALTER M. MILLER, JR\\n\\n\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\"\\nOne gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives\\ncopying blueprints from \"Saint Leibowitz\", filling the sheets of paper with\\nink and leaving white lines and letters.\\n\\nEDGAR PANGBORN\\n\\n\"Davy\"\\nPost atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,\\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\\natoms\". \\n\\nPHILIP K. DICK\\n\\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\\ntrue version.\\n\\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\\n\\nPETER DE ROSA\\n\\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener.

The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and \\nevents are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...\\n\\nWALTER M. MILLER, JR\\n\\n\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\"\\nOne gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives\\ncopying blueprints from \"Saint Leibowitz\", filling the sheets of paper with\\nink and leaving white lines and letters.\\n\\nEDGAR PANGBORN\\n\\n\"Davy\"\\nPost atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,\\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\\natoms\". \\n\\nPHILIP K. DICK\\n\\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\\ntrue version.\\n\\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\\n\\nPETER DE ROSA\\n\\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums\",\\nDroemer-Knaur, 1989)\\n\\nMICHAEL MARTIN\\n\\n\"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification\", Temple University Press,\\n Philadelphia, USA.\\nA detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding\\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\\narea.  Argues both for \"negative atheism\" (i.e. the \"non-belief in the\\nexistence of god(s)\") and also for \"positive atheism\" (\"the belief in the\\nnon-existence of god(s)\").  Includes great refutations of the most\\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\\n541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)\\n\\n\"The Case Against Christianity\", Temple University Press\\nA comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers\\nthe best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)\\ndemonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.\\n273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5\\n\\nJAMES TURNER\\n\\n\"Without God, Without Creed\", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,\\n MD, USA\\nSubtitled \"The Origins of Unbelief in America\".  Examines the way in which\\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \\n316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4\\n\\nGEORGE SELDES (Editor)\\n\\n\"The great thoughts\", Ballantine Books, New York, USA\\nA \"dictionary of quotations\" of a different kind, concentrating on statements\\nand writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person\\'s philosophy\\nand world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many\\npeople.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various\\npeople expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of\\nthe quotations are derived from Cardiff\\'s \"What Great Men Think of Religion\"\\nand Noyes\\' \"Views of Religion\".\\n490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.\\n\\nRICHARD SWINBURNE\\n\\n\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford\\nThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \"The Coherence of\\nTheism\" (1977) and was concluded with \"Faith and Reason\" (1981).  In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A. HAUGHT\\n\\n\"Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness\",\\n Prometheus Books\\nLooks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and\\nnot only by Christians.\\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-64079. 1990.\\n\\nNORM R.
